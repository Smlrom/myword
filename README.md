# Â¡Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm samuel rom, programmer :smile:

## About me
I am an enthusiast for technology and programming. 
venezolano

I have experience in the frontend, specialized in building and styling websites, as well as backend knowledge to improve service optimization.

My main passion is divided into two areas:

1. **Artificial Intelligence**: I want to create my own personal AI. In these times when AI is booming, I am taking advantage of all the tools necessary to achieve this.
2. **Video Game Development**: My biggest dream is to create a game. Currently, I am slowly learning the essentials of achieving this and, over time, I hope to assemble a trusted team to make it happen.
